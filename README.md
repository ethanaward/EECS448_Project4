Login to account, then click "Admin Page" from the Profile Page to navigate to the Admin Page, then click "Run Tests" to run the test suite.

In order to test it, you need a server to run the PHP. The EECS servers will not work, as session variables seem to be broken on them. We recommend using LAMP or its Windows/Mac equivalents, WAMP and MAMP.
